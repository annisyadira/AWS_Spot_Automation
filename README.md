# AWS_Spot_Automation

An automation system for AWS Spot Instance built with Fuzzy Inference System and Best-Worst Method. This can be a solution for one of the Spot Instance drawbacks which is the sudden termination. Although this system needs other AWS services to work out, it's proven that the Spot Instance will always be available and cost-effective (please refer to my work [here](https://www.google.com)).

*lambda_function_simulation.py* uses simulative termination signal to trigger the Lambda service. Therefore, the instance needs to be manually terminated.
